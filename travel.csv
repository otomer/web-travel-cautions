[https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-korea]","The Ministry of Health and Welfare issued a statement on Sunday, June 21, announcing they plan to limit the number of foreign nationals entering South Korea through a temporary restriction on visas and a ban on non-scheduled flights. Exceptions will be made for government officials and essential business trips.

*****International Restrictions:
Foreign nationals who have been in Hubei province in China within the previous 14 days are not permitted to enter South Korea.
From 1 June 2020, foreign nationals residing in South Korea on most types of long-term visa will need to apply for a re-entry permit at a local immigration office or at the airport before undertaking any travel out of South Korea. Those travelling with a re-entry permit will also be required to have a medical examination no earlier than 48 hours before they plan to return to South Korea, and to obtain a medical certificate in English or Korean to present to the Korean authorities on their arrival. The medical certificate must be signed by a medical professional at a recognised medical institution and include the date of the medical examination and either confirmation of a negative test for COVID-19 or a record of the presence or absence of fever, cough, chills, headache, breathing difficulty, muscle pain, and pulmonary symptoms. Long-term visa holders seeking to return to South Korea without a medical certificate may be refused entry. Long-term visa holders leaving South Korea without a re-entry permit will have their visa and Alien Registration Card cancelled and will need to obtain a new long-term visa before they can re-enter South Korea. Exceptions to this requirement include holders of A-1, A-2, A-3 and F-4 visas, or those issued with an Isolation Exemption Certificate by a Korean Embassy or consulate overseas. For further information, call the Korean Immigration Contact Centre (Tel: 1345) or see the official announcement here.
All arrivals – regardless of nationality and length of stay – are required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) and to undergo quarantine for 14 days. All individuals regardless of nationality who show coronavirus symptoms on arrival will be tested. Those who test positive will be isolated and treated at a hospital or community treatment centre.
For those not showing symptoms on arrival, Korean nationals and long term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence may self-quarantine at home. Arrivals from the USA and Europe must receive a test within three days; arrivals from elsewhere must receive a test within 14 days.
All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days on arrival. Arrivals from the USA and Europe will be tested on entry before transferring to the quarantine facility; arrivals from elsewhere will move to the quarantine facility and be tested within 14 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 100,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. There is currently no charge for hospital/community centre treatment for those testing positive. It is worth noting that individuals testing positive on arrival may spend over a month in hospital/community treatment centres before successfully testing negative and being discharged.
You can find more information on Korean arrival procedures on the Government of the Republic of Korea website [http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/baroView.do?brdId=11&brdGubun=111&dataGubun=&ncvContSeq=&contSeq=&board_id=]
There are very limited exemptions from the self-quarantine system for important – primarily COVID-19 related – business, humanitarian or academic purposes. Those with an exemption will still be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile App.
Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.
Transit passengers will receive a temperature check on arrival in Korea. Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey.
If you display symptoms or return a positive test result for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.

For Azores, 3 alternatives are offered to passengers: Arriving with a PCR test for Covid-19 done in the 72 hours before departure, with a negative result. In this case, you must present proof, on paper, of a document issued by a laboratory attesting the completion of the SARS-CoV-2 test, within 72 hours prior to the departure of the flight from the airport of origin, reporting your identification, the laboratory where the test was performed, the date of the test, the signature of the person responsible for conducting the test, and the negative result. Extending the stay for seven or more days, the passenger must, on the 6th day counting from the date of the screening test, contact the health authority of the municipality where he resides or is housed, in order to conduct a new SARS-CoV-2 screening test to be promoted by the local health authority.
Alternatively, the screening test for the SARSCoV-2 virus may be done at the moment of disembarkation. After performing the test, you must remain in prophylactic isolation at your home or place where you are staying, until you are notified of the results of the test. In this case, and extending the stay for seven or more days, the passenger must, on the 6th day counting from the date of the screening test, contact the county health authority in which he resides or is housed, in order to conduct a new SARS-CoV-2 screening test to be promoted by the local health authority.
A third option is to return to the place of origin of your flight or to travel to any airport outside the Autonomous Region of the Azores, fulfilling, until the time of the flight, prophylactic isolation in a hotel indicated for this purpose.

From 15 June, warning against tourist travel will be lifted for EU countries, the warning to remain in place for countries outside the EU until 31 August (The Local, 10.06.2020). 

*****International Restrictions:
**From EU: For travellers arriving from a country that is classified as a risk area according to the Robert Koch Institute website, a mandatory 14-day quarantine applies in almost all federal states. If the state has issued quarantine instructions to travellers from high-risk countries, travellers must isolate themselves, contact the local health authority, and notify it of their entry in Germany. This currently applies to travellers arriving from Sweden. The federal states issue the quarantine obligation under their own responsibility. Travellers should check the website of the federal state they are entering for specific rules applicable locally.
**Transit: A two-week quarantine is mandatory when entering from high-risk areas; there is also an obligation to report to the health authority. This measure can only be dispensed with if travellers have a medical certificate that confirms that there is no evidence of an infection with the SARSCoV-2 coronavirus. The medical certificate must come from a member state of the European Union or another state published by the Robert Koch Institute and must not be older than 48 hours upon arrival. Proof must be provided when entering Germany. However, there is an exception for travellers who only cross the country, if they leave Germany directly.
**Third Country Nationals: Travellers from Australia, Georgia, Canada, Montenegro, New Zealand, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay can enter without restrictions from July 2nd. This will also apply to Japan, South Korea and China - but only if these countries also allow people from Germany to enter.

To determine the possibility of entry, the previous location of the traveller is taken in consideration (instead of nationality). Regardless of the entry options in Germany, all federal states have a quarantine obligation under the Infection Protection Act for arriving and returning travellers from risk areas specified by the RKI. With the exception of passengers in transit, this also applies, in principle, to travellers with an important travel reason. Travellers with a medical certificate that demonstrates that there are no signs of infection with the SARSCoV-2 coronavirus are exempted from the quarantine requirement. The medical certificate must come from a member state of the European Union or another country published by the Robert Koch Institute at https://www.rki.de/covid-19-tests, in German or English, and must not be older than 48 hours at the time of entry.
