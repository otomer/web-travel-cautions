*****International Restrictions:
Only Australian citizens and returning permanent residents and their immediate family members are permitted to enter Australia without an exemption until further notice. Travellers who meet exemption criteria or have a compassionate or compelling reason to enter Australia can apply to the Australian authorities for an exemption <a href=""https://travel-exemptions.homeaffairs.gov.au/tep"">see here</a> . For information on the exemption categories, application form and documentation required, see the Department of Home Affairs  <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions-0"">website</a> . All international travellers entering Australia need to undertake a mandatory 14-day quarantine at a designated facility (for example a hotel) at their port of arrival. This is arranged by individual State and Territory governments. States and Territories are introducing charges for quarantine. These are already in place in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia and are likely to be introduced in other States soon. All travellers arriving in Australia may be required to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival before going into quarantine. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine.

*****Transit instructions: 
You are able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, you are not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on State and Territory <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments"">website</a> for the latest details and how to apply. All airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination. If you have to leave the airport you will be taken on arrival in Australia to a designated quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will be required to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You may be required to pay for quarantine - you should check State and Territory <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers"">website</a> for details on quarantine.

Regardless of border restrictions, you may travel by air from one to another Australian State or Territory to another to transit to an international flight as long as you hold a confirmed booking for that flight. Where state borders are closed, you may need to apply for an exemption to cross borders. You will be required to stay within the airport for the duration of your transit, or if transiting overnight, you may be taken to mandatory quarantine for the duration of your transit or may need to self-isolate in a hotel. In Western Australia, your transit time must be no more than 24 hours. Social distancing restrictions and other local measures are still in place across Australia with a number of variations. Measures currently include: restrictions on numbers of people at most non-work gatherings, in shops, cafes, restaurants and other places of public gathering, and on visitors to private residences; keeping at least 1.5 meters from others in public spaces; restrictions on entering aged care homes; limits on local travel and advice to avoid public transport at peak hours.

The government of Myanmar currently advises foreign nationals against all but essential travel to Rakhine State, in response to an increased number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the area. All townships in Rakhine State are currently subject to ‘Stay at Home’ orders. A curfew from 9pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in all townships with reported COVID-19 cases. 
Those living in an area under a ‘Stay at Home’ order should stay in their homes, unless they have permission from the local ward administrator to go outside. Permission to go outside is generally only granted to those who are preforming specific tasks recognised by the government, or for one person per household to go shopping, or for two persons per household to go to a medical hospital or clinic. If you are in an area under a ‘Stay at Home’ order you should contact the local ward administrators for details, including any requirements that may be specific to that location.
Anyone wishing to travel outside of a township subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order will need permission from the State Government. Any person travelling from a township placed under a ‘Stay at Home’ order, to another part of Myanmar will be placed in a government quarantine facility for 14 days upon arrival at their destination. This will include testing for COVID-19 for which foreign nationals may be charged. Those travelling by air will need to home quarantine for a further 7 days.

Failure to wear one will result in a fine. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of some offenders.
There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign tourists are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. If you are on a tourist visa and are not currently staying in a registered hotel or guest house, you should move into one now. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa. Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed.
Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place. Some shopping centres may require customers to register their details upon entry.

Children under the age of 12, drivers and crew members of cargo vehicles, buses, train, locomotive, aircraft, sea and river vessels are also not required to undergo self-isolation or quarantine, provided they have not been in contact with a person with COVID-19. Self-isolation on entry to Ukraine can be completed at your chosen address using the “Dii Vdoma” mobile app. You need to have a Ukrainian mobile phone number with the SIM card activated before you arrive in the country, though the SIM does not need to be in your phone on arrival. When using the app, you must respond promptly to notifications sent to your mobile (in Ukrainian). More information about the app is available on the Cabinet of Ministers website or the Visit Ukraine webpage. Make sure that you understand the regular reporting requirements before taking up this option. People who do not register with the Dii Vdoma app, or who do not abide by its terms, are required to complete quarantine at a government-approved observation centre. Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ Visit Ukraine webpage.
