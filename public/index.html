                  Level 1 - Exercise Normal Precautions: This is the lowest
                  advisory level for safety and security risk. There is some
                  risk in any international travel. Conditions in other
                  countries may differ from those in the United States and may
                  change at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Level 2 - Exercise Increased Caution: Be aware of heightened
                  risks to safety and security. The Department of State provides
                  additional advice for travelers in these areas in the Travel
                  Advisory. Conditions in any country may change at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Level 3 - Reconsider Travel: Avoid travel due to serious risks
                  to safety and security. The Department of State provides
                  additional advice for travelers in these areas in the Travel
                  Advisory. Conditions in any country may change at any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Level 4 – Do Not Travel: This is the highest advisory level
                  due to greater likelihood of life-threatening risks. During an
                  emergency, the U.S. government may have very limited ability
                  to provide assistance. The Department of State advises that
                  U.S. citizens not travel to the country or to leave as soon as
                  it is safe to do so. The Department of State provides
                  additional advice for travelers in these areas in the Travel
                  Advisory. Conditions in any country may change at any time.
